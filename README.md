## Description
Every good project needs a quality README with information about the application. It should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions.

This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on input about your project. Check out the ExampleREADME.md in this repo as an example.

## Installation
To generate your own README, git clone the repo down to your local so you have the Node project on your local. Make sure you have Node.js and the npm inquirer installed. After installing the required npm packages, use the command line to navigate to the root of the application and run node app. Follow prompts to enter project information. The generated README page will be created in the ./utils folder.

## Usage
When you run node index.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub and about your project. Click the link below to view a tutorial.

## Contributing
This is a project for my bootcamp and did not have any contributors.

## Tests
To test this app, open up the file in VS Code. Open the terminal, change directory into the root folder, and run ‘node index.js’. Answer the prompts and view the preview of the ‘generated-README.md’ file in the ‘dist’ folder.
